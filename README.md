# Ros2_Final

This is code for a game that is played between two players. The game takes place in an enclosed arena. The robot first maps the whole arena to determine various parameters. The robot then stops once it has completed mapping. This indicates the start of the game. The main rules of the game are that the player can rotate the robot as many times as they want using the bumpers located on the front. Based on which bumper is hit, the robot rotates a certain amount. Once the player is happy with where the robot is rotated, the player can hit the center bumper to send the robot forward. This process can be done 3 times each turn. Once the robot has been moved forward 3 times by one player, it is no longer their turn. Inside the arena, there are scattered objects. The goal is to collect as many as possible. The player with the most at the end will win the game.
